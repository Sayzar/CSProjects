CPUSchedulingSimulator
======================

A simulator of CPU scheduling algorithms, based off the program by Jim Weller (http://jimweller.com/jim-weller/jim/java_proc_sched/)

Implemented the processor scheduling algorithms concerning FCFS, Round Robin, SJF etc. In addition, attempted to program multilevel queue schedluing, where depending on the properties of a process, determines how and when it will be processed.
